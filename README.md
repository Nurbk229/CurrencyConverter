# CurrencyConverter

Build a simple currency converter that meet the following criteria:-

## USER INTERFACE
● The app should contain two drop-down displays that displays a list of countries
(iso-codes and flags).
● The app should contain an input field to enter the amount of currency that should be
converted and also a text view to show the result.
● The app should contain a button to switch between source and target currencies.
● The app has a menu item to turn on/off currency change monitoring feature.
● You can use any design you want as long as it has the required functions

## FUNCTIONALITY
● The users should be able to select the source currency and the target currency and
enter the amount they want to convert.
● The app should display the result of the amount entered by the user after being
converted to target currency.
● The user should be able to fast switch between source and target currency using a
button
● The start monitoring menu item should monitor the currency exchange rate of the current
currency pair and every one hour and notify the user if the rate changes.
● The user can stop monitoring any time using the same menu item.
● The menu item icon should reflect if monitoring is running or not.

## ARCHITECTURE
● You should use MVVM architecture with Android Architecture Components such as
LiveData and ViewModel.

## API
● The app should be connected with a Web API to get the conversion rate or to convert
the amount directly so the result should be up-to-date not statically saved in the app.
● These API providers might be helpful but it's up to you to search and find better ones if
you want.
